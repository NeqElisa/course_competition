            <h3><kbd>Aphrodite</kbd></h3>
            <p>Aphrodite is the Olympian goddess of love, beauty, sexual pleasure, and fertility. She is regularly attended by
few of her children, the Erotes, who are capable of stirring up passion in both mortals and gods at the goddessâ€™ will.
Portrayed as both insatiable and unattainable, Aphrodite was born near the coast of Cythera out of the foam
(aphros) Uranus' castrated genitals created when they fell into the sea. Even though married to Hephaestus,
she had affairs with all Olympians except Zeus and Hades, most famously with Ares, the god of war.
She also had famous romances with two mortals, Anchises and Adonis.</p>

              <h3><kbd>Apollo</kbd></h3>
              <p>Apollo is the Olympian god of the sun and light, music and poetry, healing and plagues, prophecy and knowledge,
order and beauty, archery and agriculture. An embodiment of the Hellenic ideal of kalokagathia, he is harmony,
reason and moderation personified, a perfect blend of physical superiority and moral virtue.
A complex deity who turns up in art and literature possibly as often as Zeus himself, Apollo is the only major
god who appears with the same name in both Greek and Roman mythology.</p>
