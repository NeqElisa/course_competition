            <h3>Aphrodite is the Olympian goddess of love, beauty, sexual pleasure, and fertility. She is regularly attended by
              few of her children, the Erotes, who are capable of stirring up passion in both mortals and gods at the goddess’ will.
              Portrayed as both insatiable and unattainable, Aphrodite was born near the coast of Cythera out of the foam
              (aphros) Uranus' castrated genitals created when they fell into the sea. Even though married to Hephaestus,
              she had affairs with all Olympians except Zeus and Hades, most famously with Ares, the god of war.
              She also had famous romances with two mortals, Anchises and Adonis.</h3>

              <h3>Apollo is the Olympian god of the sun and light, music and poetry, healing and plagues, prophecy and knowledge,
                order and beauty, archery and agriculture. An embodiment of the Hellenic ideal of kalokagathia, he is harmony,
                reason and moderation personified, a perfect blend of physical superiority and moral virtue.
                A complex deity who turns up in art and literature possibly as often as Zeus himself, Apollo is the only major
                god who appears with the same name in both Greek and Roman mythology.</h3>

                  is typically the personification of sheer violence and brutality. Consequently, he was loved neither by gods nor by men.
                  That is, with the exception of Aphrodite, who bore him many children out of wedlock.</h3>

                    and nature. No more than few days old, she helped her mother Leto give birth to her twin brother Apollo. Artemis was very
                    protective of her and her priestesses’ innocence. Consequently, she wasn’t very nice when some of them weren’t so careful.

                      Gazers upon her face would turn to stone. Most sources describe her as the daughter of Phorcys and Ceto,
                      though the author Hyginus makes her the daughter of Gorgon and Ceto. According to Hesiod and Aeschylus,
                      she lived and died on an island named Sarpedon, somewhere near Cisthene. The 2nd-century BCE novelist Dionysios
                      Skytobrachion puts her somewhere in Libya, where Herodotus had said the Berbers originated her myth,
                      as part of their religion.</h3>
